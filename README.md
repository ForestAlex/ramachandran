# ramachandran

"Mond" is the German equivalent to the meaning of the surname Ramachandran. The Ramachandran plot translates to moon plot. 

The dihedral angels $\phi$ vs. $\psi$ can be plotted in a Ramachandran plot. Three regions are often populated: The top left with $\beta$-strands and sheets, the bottom left with left-handed $\alpha$-helices and the right middle with right-handed $\alpha$-helices.
